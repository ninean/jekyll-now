**What did you do this past week?**

I've gotten more used to all of my classes. I also started doing homework and making groups in any classes that needs a group project done. I also fixed my car which took much longer than expected, so I didn't get as much time as I wanted to get started with the Collatz assignment.
I was able to at least finish the quiz for academic integrity.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I still need to figure out how I will divide my time between all my classes and where I can do my work. I have a strange mix of classes that require readings, programming, group presentations, and report writing. 

**What will you do next week?**

Finish up the Collatz project in this class. I will also probably check out the McCombs career fair.

**Class Experience**

I'm actually pretty glad there is a ranking system implemented. This way, I can know how I am doing compared to the rest of the class in a bit more easily that what the canvas box and whisker graphs can show me. I think this will keep me and other people motivated while not discouraging those that have a lower rank. 

I'm a bit confused as to what kind of notes I should be taking in class. It seems a lot of the material covered ends up being posted to piazza, but I'm not sure how much of the other topics covered I need to write down.

**Tip of the Week**

Use the TAs to your full advantage. I had some issues setting up Docker, and speaking with a TA during office hours really helped out a lot. I also really like that there is a session Tuesday nights. People usually don't have classes or exams Tuesday nights so it makes it so there will be at least one TA session most every can attend if they need help.
