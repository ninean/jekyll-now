**What did you do this past week?**

I finished up Collatz. It was a interesting project, and definitely got me more used to working in python. I had only had very light python experience in the past.
Working with Sphere was a little tricky, but once I learned what special cases it tested, it took only a few fixes before I could focus on optimization.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

Recruitig season is starting, and I need to stay on top of all my classes while researching companies I would be interested in interning for. I also need to balance class time, work time, and company event times.

I had an internship this past summer, and it opened my eyes to just how important an intership is to your experience learning about what you want to do, so I want to put more focus on internship-hunting this semester, but I also have a heavier courseload this semester.

**What will you do next week?**

Start researching companies I wasnt to speak with for the career fair. I will also try to keep up with the class notes and examples given on Downing's website.

**Class Experience**

I'm glad that there is a system set up where the TAs can email you to let you know that something is wrong with your submisison and give you a chance to correct it (even if it's for a penalty.
I think this is a lot better than having a surprise 0 show up n Canvas two weeks later, and then having to ask for a regrade.

**Tip of the Week**

Start early and don't be afraid to use Piazza. I felt a bit scared when I realized you can't post anonymously on Piazza for this course, but then I realized no one judges you for how dumb your question may seem.
Odds are, there are a dozen other people with the same question as you, and you just became their hero by asking the question.
