**What did you do this past week?**

Began all of my classes. I realized there were more people in SWE that I recognize that I expected, so that was a treat. I hope to be able to work and get to know even more of my classmates. This includes people I have previously worked with, and people I have never had the chance to work in a group project with. After the first class, I struggled a bit in the GDC labs before I realized we can't install docker there. I should have paid more attentin to the website and class.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I have a class in RLM right after SWE, so getting there thorugh the crowd of people on speedway is difficult to do within the 10 minutes I have between classes. I am tring alternative paths up the UT bridge to see if that can shorten my commute time.

**What will you do next week?**

I will try to get Docker and other related tools installed so that I can be ready for the first project. 

**Class Experience**

So far, Professor Downing is very engaging and active in class. I've had many professors that are hard to follow, so Professor Downing's very exact way of showing code and what certain line of code do in the first 2 classes were very easy to follow and easy to reference back.

I am a little concerned about the amount of work that will be involved with this class. I am taking 4 other classes, but only one other CS class so hopefully I can manage. This will all depend on how intensive the other classes will end up being.

**Tip of the Week**

Come to class early. Getting there late means that you may lose time on the quiz which ends 3 minutes after class starts.
