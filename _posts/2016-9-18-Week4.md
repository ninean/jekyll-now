**What did you do this past week?**

This past week I worked on a Network Security project and Netflix assignment for this class. 
I also started making and bringing my own lunches. Campus food is way too expensive to eat so regularly.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

This next whole week, honestly. I still have some preparations to do for career fair while balancing finishing the Netflix project. 

**What will you do next week?**

Finish up the Netflix project in this class. I will also check out the CNS career fair and Friends of CS brunch. 
I'm also having my first round of exams this week, and I need to take time to study for those. 
It's never a good idea to do poorly on your first exams, after all.

**Class Experience**

Even through an assignment may seem like it will only take X number of hours, remember there's a whole lot of overhead with getting meetings with group members set up, and then getting a solid understanding of what is exactly written in the project requirements.
**Tip of the Week**

Screenhero is a screensharing software that can be especially useful for when you and a partner can't meet up. It allows for a good alternative for pair programming in person. 
The person given a screen to look at can even take control of the screen and start typing more seamlessly than with Skype's screensharing feature.
I would not do most of my pair programming this way, but in the case that a person is out of town or sick with something contagious, it allows for good online interaction.
